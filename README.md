# My DJ Mixing App
(lol, naming is... hard?). A terminal-based audio player and library manager for "DJs".

## Goals

This is primarily an experiment and learning exercise.
- Golang. Never used it, want to use it.
- TUIs. Never built one! I also don't spend enough time in the terminal. Maybe this finally makes me learn neovim.

It might turn into something functional that scratches my own itch.

## Functionality

I did mention scratching my own itch... I am a (very) amateur DJ. I mostly play for myself, sometimes a few friends.

I listen to music all daylong whilst writing code for money. I often hear two songs in a row that blend well and think "yo I want to remember those two go together" without breaking the rest of my flow.

I also find myself wanting:
- a better tagging system then what Apple Music/iTunes offers (yes I just use Apple Music.app to manage my mp3s, it was just.... there).
- the ability to construct playlists (and sub-playlists) when preparing mixes -- again in a low-friction, focus-retaining way.
    - arrange songs in an order
    - mark two as "good to together"
    - have a separate list of songs that might work, but aren't yet arranged
    - extra cool: song recommender
- the ability to play two songs at once with some super basic mixing controls (bpm, 3-band EQ, volume, possibly some simple loop controls)

You can do most (all?) of these things in Rekordbox (or Traktor or Mixxx or whatever your DJ software of choice is), _however_ launching those applications is massively focus-destroying (and slow). If I have Rekordbox running, I get no work done. Also the learning/experiment part of this.

### Inspiration

I thought what I wanted didn't really exist in any form for a while, until I found these two things:

[Beatport DJ](https://dj.beatport.com/) looks _very_ much like what I imagine for the player/mixer side of this.
[Lexicon](https://www.lexicondj.com/) looks _very_ much like what I imagine for the library management/tagging/grouping side of this.

But: I don't have a Beatport Streaming subscription, I don't want to pay a monthly subscription for Lexicon (to be fair, it looks like great software, and great software is worth paying for, I just need to keep this a "cheap" hobby), terminal-based tools are less focus disturbing, oh and I want to learn some stuff. It's been too long since I hacked on software just cause I can.

## Status

Absolutely nowhere!
